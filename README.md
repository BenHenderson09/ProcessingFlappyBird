# ProcessingFlappyBird
This program is a basic implimentation of the "Flappy Bird" mobile game.

## Program Details
- Developed using Processing

## What can it be used for?
This program was not made because I wanted to make a flappy bird implimentation, this program is designed as a model for machine learning.
By making this game in Processing it will not be very difficult to control the gamestate, access variables etc.
